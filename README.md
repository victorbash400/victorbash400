## 🚀 About Me

Finance major on paper, hardcore developer in practice. I'm that guy who disappears for 48 hours during hackathons and emerges with surprisingly polished projects. Currently based in Nairobi, but my code runs worldwide.

When I'm not pushing commits at 3 AM, you might find me optimizing my workspace, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, or deep-diving into new tech documentation (yes, for fun).
