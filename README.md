# Victor Bash

**Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer**

I build web applications that think.

I operate at the intersection of modern web development and artificial intelligence. My philosophy is simple: **TypeScript** for robust, scalable user interfaces, and **Python** for the heavy lifting in AI and data processing.

I believe this combination is the future of software architecture—where type safety meets machine intelligence.

### The Stack

I am a specialist in the Python/TypeScript duality. I don't just use these languages; I build ecosystems around them.

**TypeScript **
* **React & Next.js:** For building high-performance, server-rendered applications.
* **Type Safety:** I write strict, maintainable code that scales without breaking.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, clean UI development.

**Python **
* **FastAPI:** My go-to for building high-concurrency, async backends.
* **AI Engineering:** PyTorch, LangChain, and vector databases.
* **Automation:** Scripting complex workflows and agentic behaviors.

**Infrastructure**
* **Cloud:** AWS & Google Cloud .
* **Data:** PostgreSQL and Redis for state; GraphDBs for knowledge.

### AI & The Future

I am genuinely obsessed with the pace of AI development. I am not just adding API calls to apps; I am exploring how **Agents**, **LLMs**, and **RAG** pipelines can fundamentally change how we interact with the web.

### Connect

I'm always down to talk about the newest Next.js release, the latest open-source LLM benchmarks, or why TypeScript is non-negotiable for frontend work.
