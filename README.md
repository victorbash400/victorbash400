## üí´ The TL;DR

```python
class VictorBash:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Victor Bash"
        self.location = "Nairobi, Kenya üá∞üá™"
        self.education = "Finance (officially) but Computer Science (where my heart is)"
        self.superpower = "Turning coffee and pancakes into code"
        self.sleep_status = "Optional"
        self.avocado_tolerance = 0
    
    def current_mode(self):
        return "Hackathon beast mode: ACTIVATED"
```

## üöÄ About Me

Finance major on paper, hardcore developer in practice. I'm that guy who disappears for 48 hours during hackathons and emerges with surprisingly polished projects. Currently based in Nairobi but my code runs worldwide.

When I'm not pushing commits at 3 AM, you might find me optimizing my workspace, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, or deep-diving into new tech documentation (yes, for fun).

## üèÜ Hackathon Life

Hackathons aren't just events for me ‚Äì they're a lifestyle. There's nothing quite like the adrenaline rush of building something impressive under impossible deadlines. My approach:

1. **Understand the problem** ‚û°Ô∏è Overscope ‚û°Ô∏è Build MVP ‚û°Ô∏è Polish until it looks professional
2. **Sleep?** That's what the week after is for
3. **Fuel source:** Strategic coffee intake and pancake power-ups
4. **Secret weapon:** Turning caffeine-induced panic into elegant system architecture

Current status: Probably registered for more hackathons than there are weekends in the month.

## üß† My Philosophy

> "Why build it in two weeks when you can build it in 48 hours of pure focus?"

I believe in:
- Clean, minimalist design (in both UI and life)
- Building with scalability in mind from day one
- Learning technologies at warp speed when needed
- Shipping products that feel complete, not prototypes
- The perfect workspace setup is worth every penny

## ‚ö° Fun Facts

- I can explain complex system architecture while making pancakes (multitasking mastery)
- My code is cleaner than my room during hackathon season
- I've developed a sixth sense for debugging Azure deployments
- Can transition from "what's blockchain?" to implementing Hedera wallet authentication faster than most people set up their development environment
- Have strong opinions about keyboard switches that I'm willing to defend passionately
- Avocados are my sworn enemy ü•ë‚ùå

## üî• What I'm Up To

- Juggling multiple hackathons while maintaining sanity (results may vary)
- Optimizing my tech setup and workflow for maximum productivity
- Exploring the intersection of AI, blockchain, and real-world applications
- Convincing myself that starting another project is definitely a good idea
- Searching for the perfect pancake recipe to fuel late-night coding sessions

## üì´ Connect With Me

I'm always up for discussing tech, hackathons, system design, or why avocados are overrated. Drop me a message if you're into any of these things (except avocados).
